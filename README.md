# Currency Converter App

This is a Python GUI application that converts between common fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. It uses the `forex-python` library for fiat currency rates and the CoinGecko API to get live cryptocurrency prices. The app also features an auto-refresh every 5 seconds to keep conversion rates updated in real-time.

## How This Project Was Built

The base of this project was inspired by and built following this YouTube tutorial:  
[Currency Converter Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4KGT7EvX1o)

After completing the main tutorial, I decided to enhance the app by:

- Adding support for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and more using the CoinGecko API.
- Implementing live automatic refresh of conversion rates every 5 seconds.
- Tweaking the user interface and improving error handling for a better user experience.
